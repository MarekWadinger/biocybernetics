# Modeling Heart Rate

### Tasks
1. Measure the transient change in heart rate (TF) in response to a reduction in your body's ongoing physical activity. The initial state is the heart rate during increased physical exertion, then you enter a state of rest when you record a transient event (TF). Follow the teacher's instructions.
2. Create a dynamic model of the above event. Choose the structure of the model and the method of identification appropriately. Compare the measured TF with the model response.
