# Blood Pressure

### Tasks
1. Calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) as measured blood pressure (BP) data from the rat as a response to BP for L-name administration. Filter the obtained course using a moving average filter. Display all three signals in a common graph (KT, MAP, MAPfilt), each in a different color.
2. Identify the dynamic MAPfilt response model to the L-name administration
3. Calculate the course of the heart rate from the course of blood pressure and display it in the next graph. Identify a dynamic heart rate response (TF) model. Compare the response of the model with the actual course of TF.
